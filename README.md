Welcome to the nutronauts github site. 

Here, we are making a project to predict flood prone areas, forest fire, and drought affected areas in persistently occuring parts of India.

Our team's goal is to clustrize areas which are frequently affected to natural disasters in India, and figure out the sustainable infrastructure to overcome them.

Based on previous years data, we train our Polynomial Regression and Artificial Nueral Network Algorithms to predict the successive outcomes of our data set and use it to find the probable chance of above disasters happening in respective areas.

Any users interested can contribute by provide the contents for datasets listed below, and also can update the required datasets of a concerned area.

Datasets required to be dealt with are :-
Historic flood warnings, Historic flood alerts, Indecent flood alerts, Rainfall rank ordered statistics, Rainfall grids, Relative humidity, Temperature, Wind, Fuel moisture codes, Fire behaviour index, Area affected, Nighttime light, Vegetation Real-time, Fire Real-time, True Colour Real-time.

Technologies used are :-
Statistics, Machine learning techniques luke Multivariate Neural networks and Polynomial Regression, Information retrieval.

Finally, our project will be implemented using MATLAB and Microsoft Azure cloud platform through our website.
