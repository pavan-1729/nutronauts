Welcome to the nutronauts github site. 

Here, we are making a project to predict flood prone areas, forest fire, and drought affected areas in persistently occuring parts of India.

Our team's goal is to clustrize areas which are frequently affected to natural disasters in India, and figure out the sustainable infrastructure to overcome them.
